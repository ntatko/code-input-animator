# Code Input Animator

Code Input Animator is a simple web application that animates the typing of code snippets. It is built with React using Vite.

## Instructions

Set up your code in the top box how you want the recording to start. You'll see your changes mirrored in the bottom box as you start.

Click the record button to start recording. You can pause and resume the recording as needed. When you're done editing your code, click the stop button.

You can then play back the recording by clicking the play button. You can also pause and resume the playback as needed. You'll use a screen recorder to capture the playback, so try to get as close to the green edges as possible, or be ready to do that in post.
